## Things I learned/gained experience with along the way

- Vue 3
  - Gained familiarity with some of the breaking changes - this will be helpful as we look towards upgrading to Vue 3 at my current role
  - Composition API - helps a lot with TypeScript support
  - The [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) VSCode extension has great TypeScript support for Vue. I experienced some performance issues, but I found the development experience easier than with Vetur.
  - The `<transition>` component
  - CSS transitions
- Vuex 4 - From what I gather, this is essentially a port of Vuex to Vue 3, and Vuex 5 is expected to be based on [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/). Also Pinia's logo is really cute.
- Vuetify (3.0 prerelease) - I found it easy to use and encountered no significant issues. Version 3.0.0-alpha.12 doesn't have the tabs and transition components completed, but I was interested in previewing how things looked overall.
