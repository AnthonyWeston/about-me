# Pronouns

My pronouns are he/him/his.

I've found that small gestures such as displaying my pronouns or a symbol of allyship at my desk can have a strong impact. Demonstrating my support in this way helps others achieve their development goals by reducing the burden they experience in ensuring that their safety needs are met.
