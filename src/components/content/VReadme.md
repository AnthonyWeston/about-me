# README

Welcome to my GitHub page!


I developed this to showcase my experience as a developer, and to test drive some things I've been interested in trying out. While you're here, try out some of the following to see more content:


* Click or hover any underlined link text in about-me.ts to see more information about the topic.
* Click the footer for dependency information.
* Use the menu to see extras (under construction/coming soon)
